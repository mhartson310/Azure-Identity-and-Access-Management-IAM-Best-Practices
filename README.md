## Overview

In today’s cloud environments, securing identity and access is paramount. This repository includes:
- **Documentation** covering architecture, best practices, and troubleshooting.
- **Automation Playbooks** (using Azure Logic Apps) for enforcing conditional access, MFA, and automating PIM.
- **ARM Templates** for deploying secure policies and configurations.

Our goal is to help you achieve a Zero Trust posture by enforcing strict identity and access controls across your Azure environment.

## Features

- **Conditional Access Playbook:** Automatically enforce policies based on user location, risk, and device state.
- **MFA Enforcement Playbook:** Automate MFA configuration and monitoring.
- **PIM Automation Playbook:** Manage and monitor privileged identities with just-in-time access.
- **ARM Templates:** Deploy secure configurations quickly and consistently.



## Usage Instructions

   - Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for an overview of the secure Azure AD architecture.
   - Follow [docs/best-practices.md](docs/best-practices.md) for detailed guidance on implementing IAM best practices.
   - Refer to [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) for common issues and fixes.

2. **Deploying Playbooks and Templates:**  
   - Import the playbook JSON files in the `playbooks/` folder into Azure Logic Apps.  
   - Customize the ARM templates in the `templates/` folder to suit your environment.
   - Deploy the ARM templates using Azure CLI or the Azure Portal.

3. **Automation:**
