# Business Case Proof of Concept Worksheet
## Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) Best Practices

### 1. Project Summary
- **Title:** Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) Best Practices Implementation
- **Description:** Demonstrate how automation and best practices in Azure AD (including MFA, Conditional Access, and PIM) enhance identity security and compliance.
- **Goals:** 
  - Enhance security posture
  - Enforce conditional access policies
  - Automate privileged identity management
- **Stakeholders:** IT Security Team, Compliance Officers, Cloud Architects

### 2. Objectives

- Reduce risk of unauthorized access and streamline compliance processes.

### 3. Requirements
- Azure AD Premium licenses (for MFA, PIM, etc.)
- Access to Azure Portal, Azure Logic Apps, and ARM deployment tools.
- Integration with existing monitoring/logging systems.

### 4. Proposed Solution
- Deploy playbooks for MFA enforcement and conditional access.
- Use ARM templates for deploying secure policies.
- Leverage Azure AD PIM for managing privileged access on a just-in-time basis.

### 5. Risks and Mitigation
- **Implementation Complexity:** Pilot with a small group; provide training.
- **Cost Overruns:** Conduct thorough budgeting and phased deployment.
- **Integration Challenges:** Collaborate closely with IT operations and conduct testing.

### 6. Expected Benefits
- Improved security and compliance.
- Reduced operational overhead through automation.
- Faster incident response times.
- Decreased risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

### 7. Estimated Costs
- **Licensing:** Azure AD Premium costs.
- **Implementation:** Development, testing, and training.
- **Ongoing:** Maintenance, monitoring, and periodic audits.

### 8. ROI & Metrics
- **Key Metrics:** Reduction in unauthorized access incidents, improved compliance scores, time savings.
- **ROI:** Savings from reduced incident response efforts and operational efficiency.
- **Payback Period:** Estimated 6â€“12 months.

### 9. Timeline
- **Phase 1:** Planning & Requirements (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Development & Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** Pilot Deployment (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Full Rollout & Monitoring (4 weeks)

### 10. Next Steps
- Review and approve the business case.
- Assemble the project team and assign roles.
